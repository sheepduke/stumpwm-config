*Archiving Note*

This repository has been archived on 2020-02-05.

The author (me) no longer uses StumpWM. I have started to use XMonad (written
in Haskell) and am pretty happy with it.

I have encountered several crashes of StumpWM on different machines. Although
I really appreciate the live-hacking nature of StumpWM, XMonad provides a more
stable user experience.
